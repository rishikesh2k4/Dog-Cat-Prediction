# Cat vs Dog Image Classifier

A machine learning project that classifies images of cats and dogs using HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) features and an SGD Classifier.

**📌 Project Summary**

This model:
- Loads grayscale cat and dog images.
- Extracts HOG features from each image.
- Trains a Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) classifier.
- Evaluates the model’s performance.
- Allows testing on new images to predict whether the input is a cat or a dog.
